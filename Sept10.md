QMA-completeness (Quantum PCP)

Adiobatic / Stochastic QC

Topological Field Theory   = BQP (it can do exactly what classical quantum computers can do)
   Jordan Lep-Preskill \subset BQP  (can be simulated by BQP)

Beyond QC? even more than BQP
e.g. quantum computing through closed timelike curve

"It's hard to know what polynomial time means if you don't know what time is in these theories"
"we don't know how to solve NP-complete problems with QC. sometimes we get polynomial speedup, but not exponential speedup"

Making QC Fail

"QC seems to be a little more stronger than classical computing. Factoring instead of NP-complete.
Differ from analog computer: if it gives you anyting, it gives you NP-complete, P-space..."

Church-Turing Thesis: "Computable" = "Computable on a TM"
connecting Physics and Computing
Physical C-T thesis: every physical process can be simulated on a TM
 - only state one direction, not stating the other direction. "the other direction has been proved by the Sillicon Valley"
"We're not interested in a physical system for which you do not know the initial state."
"It (Physical C-T thesis) is a falsifiable statement."

"Classical quantum mechanics does not pose any challenge of the physical C-T thesis.
because It's completely OK if your simulation just produce the probability distribution of the outcome."


Extended Church-Turing thesis:
"efficiently computable" = "In P"   ("assuming you know what P is")
Physical ECT thesis:
Every physical process can be simulated by a TM with polynomial overhead.
"a little bit vague about the definition of resources". "the time it runs for, the space it takes".
This is severely challenged by QC.
How to falsify physical ECT?
